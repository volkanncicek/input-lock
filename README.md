Ever tried to wipe down your keyboard, only to accidentally type `asdflkjfslkj` into a work chat and send it? Or maybe your cat decided your laptop was the perfect napping spot during an important task?

**Input Lock is the simple, elegant solution.** It's a lightweight Windows app that puts up a clean, fullscreen overlay and completely blocks your keyboard and mouse. When the timer is up, everything goes back to normal.

## ‚ú® Features

- **One-Click Lock:** A simple, intuitive UI to start the lock.
- **Timed & Secure:** A default 2-minute timer gives you plenty of time to clean.
- **Emergency Hatch:** Can't wait? Use the customizable emergency unlock combo (`Shift + Alt + L` by default).
- **Smart Theming:** Automatically adapts to your Windows light or dark mode.
- **Total Block:** Disables mouse movement, clicks, and all keyboard input.
- **Native Look & Feel:** Blends in perfectly with your Windows 10/11 desktop.

## üöÄ Get Started in 60 Seconds

### The Easy Way (Recommended)

No complex setup needed. Just download and run!

2.  Double-click the downloaded file to run it.
3.  That's it!

### For Developers (Running from Source)

If you want to tinker with the code:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/volkanncicek/input-lock.git
    cd input-lock
    ```
2.  **Set up a virtual environment:**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Using Input Lock is as easy as 1-2-3.

1.  **LOCK:** Launch the app and click the big **`Lock`** button.
2.  **CLEAN:** Your screen is now locked. Wipe down your keyboard, clean your monitor, or step away with peace of mind. A countdown timer shows you how much time is left.
3.  **DONE:** The system unlocks automatically when the timer hits zero. To unlock early, just press the emergency hotkey: **`Shift + Alt + L`**.
